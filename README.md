One of my main takeaways from this article is that a SWE does not just code all day. There is a lot of testing, maintaining and meetings around features that need to be built ot. 

Another takeaway is that preparing for SWE interviews is a several month process. It is not something that can be done in a week or two. 




# Ryan Rim's Comment

Yes, I completely agree that a SWE position does not consist of pure coding. It involves alot of testing for stability, compatability, and growth for the future. This makes more sense in non-tech companies, whose primary goals with SWEs are not to produce new, improved code but to create a stable digital infrastructure that furthers their virtual presence for both current and future services.
